# This is an example of valid feeds file for Newsraft.

# Lines with # character at the beginning are comments,
# they are completely ignored by the parser.

# To subscribe to a feed, you have to add a line with its URL:
https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
https://www.pepper.pl/rss/nowe
https://kbd.news/rss2.php

# If you want to assign a custom name to the feed,
# put a double quoted string after its URL:
http://example.org/feed2.xml "Faculty notifications"

# Lines with @ character at the beginning are section declarations,
# they are used to organize your feed entries and process them in groups.
# All feed entries after this declaration will belong to this section.
@ News Reports
http://example.org/feed3.xml "Local news"

# This feed entry belongs to the "News Reports" section:
http://example.org/feed4.xml "Global news"

# Another section declaration will cause next feed entries to be added to the
# corresponding section. Thus, the following feed entries will not belong to
# the "News Reports" section, but to the "Blog Posts" section.
@ Blog Posts
http://example.org/feed5.xml "John Johnson"
http://example.org/feed6.xml "Peter Peterson"

# As you might have noticed, feeds http://example.org/feed1.xml and
# http://example.org/feed2.xml don't belong to any section; but actually they
# do - all feed entries are de facto included in the "Global" section (even
# those that have been assigned to section by a section declaration).
# Therefore, to continue adding feed entries without being included in previous
# section, you must declare the beginning of the "Global" section:
@ Global
http://example.org/feed7.xml "Weather warnings"
